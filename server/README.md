**This is the Back-End (server-side) of the Nokie Web Application.**

The Back-End is built with Node, Express, Axios for the CRUD of the application, and PostgreSQL for the database. The Back-End communicates with the Front-End via deploying (asynchronously) the data from the database, using an API CRUD call with the data being sent client-side to the React web app.

**Nokie** is a Full Stack Web Application that allows users to anonymously share their feelings and thoughts with others. Users can create posts, comment on posts, and like posts. Users can also search for posts by keyword or by user. Users can also view their own posts and comments.
