**This is the Front-End (client-side) of the Nokie Web Application.**

The Front-End is built with React and Redux. The Front-End communicates with the Back-End via fetching (asynchronously) from the API calling to the database.

**Nokie** is a Full Stack Web Application that allows users to anonymously share their feelings and thoughts with others. Users can create posts, comment on posts, and like posts. Users can also search for posts by keyword or by user. Users can also view their own posts and comments.
